## Project Overview

This project provides an end-to-end solution to process and analyze data from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The dataset includes detailed records about athletes, coaches, teams, disciplines, and gender-specific entries. The goal is to enable comprehensive analysis of the dataset, leveraging Azure services and Power BI for insightful visualizations.

## Data Sources

The dataset includes the following key components:

- **Athletes**: Personal information, disciplines, country representation, and gender.
- **Coaches**: Names and roles of coaches.
- **Teams**: Information about 743 teams participating in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
- **Disciplines**: The 47 sports and disciplines included in the Olympics.
- **Entries by Gender**: Gender-specific entry data for athletes.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Azure Data Factory**: For ingesting raw data into the data lake.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data transformation, cleaning, and processing.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: For scalable and efficient storage of transformed data.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For direct transformation of raw data (alternative to Databricks).
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Pipeline Overview

### Data Ingestion

1. **Raw Dataset Ingestion**:  
   The raw dataset is ingested into **Azure Data Lake** using **Azure Data Factory** pipelines. This step ensures that all relevant data related to athletes, coaches, teams, and disciplines is securely stored for further processing.

### Data Transformation

2. **Data Transformation Using Databricks**:  
   The raw data is transformed using **Azure Databricks**. This includes data cleaning, structuring, and preparation for analysis. The transformed data is then stored back in the data lake.

### Data Storage

3. **Loading Transformed Data into Data Lake Gen2**:  
   The transformed data is loaded into **Azure Data Lake Gen2** for scalable and efficient storage. This makes it easy to retrieve and work with large datasets.

### Alternative Transformation Using Synapse Analytics

4. **Direct Transformation with Synapse Analytics**:  
   As an alternative to Databricks, raw data can be transformed directly using **Azure Synapse Analytics**. This allows for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis within a single platform.

### Data Visualization with Power BI

5. **Power BI Dashboard**:  
   The transformed data is then connected to **Power BI** for visualization and reporting. Interactive dashboards are created to visualize insights such as athlete performance, medal counts, team statistics, and gender distributions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription**: Make sure you have an active Azure account.
2. **Power BI**: Install Power BI Desktop for visualization.
3. **Databricks**: Set up an Azure Databricks workspace (if using Databricks for transformation).
4. **Synapse Analytics**: Set up Azure Synapse Analytics workspace (if using Synapse Analytics for transformation).

### Steps to Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tokyo-olympics-data-pipeline.git
Follow the instructions in the docs/ folder (or relevant instructions in the repository) to configure the Azure services and prepare the environment.
Usage
Data Ingestion:
Use Azure Data Factory to ingest raw data into the data lake.

Data Transformation:
Use Azure Databricks or Synapse Analytics to transform the raw data.

Data Storage:
Store the cleaned and transformed data in Azure Data Lake Gen2.

Data Visualization:
Connect the transformed data to Power BI to create visualizations and interactive dashboards.
